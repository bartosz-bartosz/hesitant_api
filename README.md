# hesitant_api

Main Python API project using FastAPI & SQLAlchemy frameworks with MySQL DB.

Currently developing PLANTS app for managing home plants. 
The aim of this project is to provide an efficient and easy-to-use solution for managing home plants - keeping track of watering them, gathering statistics, and generally not making them die.
